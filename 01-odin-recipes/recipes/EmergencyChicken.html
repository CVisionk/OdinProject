  <h2>Emergency Chicken Breast Recipe</h2>
  <p>This is a great recipe for a quick and easy entree. My wife, who is 8 1/2 months pregnant,
    had chicken thawing and asked me to cook since she was exhausted. She didn't have any plans
    so I just threw some things together and came up with this recipe. I'm sure it could be
     improved upon, but in a pinch it was easy and delicious.
  </p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
    <li>⅔ cup barbeque sauce</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>⅔ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    <li>½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken pieces - cut into 1/2-inch stripst</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
    <li>1 pound beef round steak, cut into thin strips</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir barbeque sauce,
       Worcestershire sauce, and garlic powder together with the melted 
       butter. Stir chicken into the sauce mixture to coat.</li>
    <li>Place cover on saucepan and simmer until the chicken pieces are
      cooked through and no longer pink in the middle, 3 to 5 minutes.
      Remove cover and spoon sauce over chicken pieces; continue cooking
      until sauce thickens, about 4 minutes more.</li>
  </ol>
